##Link to application
The final product can be found [here](http://bit.ly/1QN3v5x). Please allow the application a few moments to initialize. 

##Description  
This directory contains all of the slides, data, and files for my Coursera final project, which was creating an n-gram text prediction app (inspired by the SwiftKeyTM application for iOS and Android). 

##This directory  includes the following:

- `README.txt` - what you are reading at this very moment in time. 

- `.R files` - files used to clean text corpora and develop prediction algorithm

- slide deck: contains all of slides I used to make a pitch for the application for the course.  

- app folder: contains the server.R and ui.R files to make the application in Shiny
